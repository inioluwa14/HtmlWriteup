        <p>I have really enjoyed this course and all the tools and tecchnologies we have used. One of the is CSS 
            which means Cascading StyleSheets. It is refer to as the design of a webpage. This is where colors etc 
            are added to further beautify a website. Without css, a website will basically look plain, bare, basic 
            and boring. If you love colors and designs, CSS will be a walk in the park for you. CSS is actually 
            <b>very</b> easy to learn. Keep learning dear learners! But to make a strong and positive first 
            impression, it needs to be top-notch. And for that, testing the product for bugs is a must.</p>

        <p>There is a different between paddings, margins and border. padding is the space between the content and the 
            border. Margin is the space aroung the element. Border is a line between the margin and padding. An enterprise 
            can bring value to their customers only when the product delivered is ideal. And to achieve that, organizations have to make sure that users donâ€™t face 
            any issues while using their product. The fool-proof way of doing it is by making your product bug-free.</p>
